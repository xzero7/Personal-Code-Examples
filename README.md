# Personal-Code-Examples
A repo to hold code examples taken from my professional experiences. All is taken out of context from its original intention and its mean solely to showcase and be a reference for things I have learned throughout the years. At the moment I hope to showcase some things I have worked out and use them as a reference for the future.

# Drupal Examples
I have worked with Drupal 8 building out systems from the ground up. This directory holds some interesting modules I developed. Nothing in here will actually work if taken as is. A lot is missing from its original context and I hope the code here serves as insight for learning.

# GraphQL Examples
It is only recently I got my hands in working with GraphQL but I was able to build some neat integrations. The main thing in this example directory is some code I wrote to work with Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

# ReactJs Examples
ReactJS is another thing I recently acquired as a skill so this is an area of active growth for me. I hope to put in components that I build that could be resuable if tweaked and put in the right contexts.


**DISCLAIMER**
This code will not work as is if just taken as is, there are other pieces missing that will not allow it to work as described.
