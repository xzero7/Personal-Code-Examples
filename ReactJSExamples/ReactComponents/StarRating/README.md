# Learning to Build ReactJS Components with Styled Components

Starting out working with react, the idea was to build simple components that can be used on different kinds of pages. I created a Star Rating component which is just a nice simple  5 star metric that can be placed.

# A Practical Application

You could place this on a say a page that talks about a movie or show and give it a rating from 1 to 5. **starRating** is a prop that can be passed when using the component that takes an integer. This works for 5 star scale system.

# Index File

I put everything needed into this file. Creating the needed style components and declaring them on top. Styling was one on my weaker points so this part I had lots of help from other developers.

# StarRating Test
Builds a React test to run with automated unit test to ensure component would behave as expected. Very bare bones but it was something I did as I started to learn.
